#How to use it

When the page is loaded you will see thirty ants with different dimension walking against the mouse, 
but when you click they will flee from the mouse pointer. You can change the behavior by clicking the mouse. 

You will notice that the pace of the ants is different from ant to ant and the bigger ants are slower than the smaller ants.
